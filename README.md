@Todo

## Start NestJS Backend

> Edit Environment

Add a `.env` file to your project root directory and populate as follows:

```env
AUTH0_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET

JWT_SECRET=YOUR_JWT_SECRET

DB_NAME=YOUR_DB_NAME
DB_PORT=YOUR_DB_PORT
DB_HOST=YOUR_DB_HOST
DB_USER=YOUR_DB_USERNAME
DB_PASS=YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
```

Here's how to get the required Auth0 details, you need to register an client (application) in your Auth0 dashboard.

Follow these steps to register a client with Auth0:

- Open the [Auth0 Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/?_gl=1*1a4zekg*_ga*Mjg3MzE5NzcyLjE3MzcwMjU4MzA.*_ga_QKMSDV5369*MTczNzIwMTkzNy45LjEuMTczNzIwMTk1Ni40MS4wLjA.#/applications) section of the Auth0 Dashboard.

- Click on the Create Application button.

- Provide a Name, such as "GitHub Auth".

- Choose `Single Page Web Applications` as the application type.

- Click on the Create button.

- Finally, note down your `Domain`, `Client ID`, and `Client Secret` and add them to your `.env` file. Click the settings tab if you do not see them.

Choose a random string of letters and nummbers for your `JWT_SECRET` and populate the `DB_` fields with the appropriate data from your database.

> Run the following to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

OR

```bash
yarn
```

> Now create your database

If you haven't already, run the following to create your database

```bash
cd src/database
node db-init.js
```

> Run your server

```bash
npm start
```

OR

```bash
yarn start
```
